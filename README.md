# rider_app

A new Flutter application.

## App Overview

Traveling can be a tiring and depleting task. One of the ways we feel that travel is not being addressed at the moment is for traveling sleeping passengers.  Traditional tracking apps and safety features rely on manual intervention on behalf of an additional party such as family checking the userâ€™s location and do little to notify the user about arriving at their destination, waking the user, and providing automatic safety checks. In our research, we could not find any automatic self-tracking for sleeping and travel safety. Popular tracking apps that exist limit functionality to simple location tracking and sharing with friends.We want to provide individuals with peace of mind for those that do fall asleep on public transport, those that wish to but are too wary, and those that wish for consistent and automatic safety checks during travel. To accomplish this mission, we developed a travel tracking app that allows for not just location sharing with friends and family but also automatic self-monitoring. From a technical perspective, we can provide this solution by allowing customers to input their travel destination and then when they travel, allow them to set a wake-up alarm or notification for when they approach their destination by tracking their location and using geo-fencing. Individuals traveling using various modes of public transportation and ride-sharing apps can experience a greater level of safety and peace of mind by using an app that incorporates automatic safety checking and sleep-notification mode on top of the traditional features of tracking/travel apps.
